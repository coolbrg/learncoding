Writing a larger program
Now we know enough about Python for creating a program that is actually useful. Awesome!

In this tutorial we'll write a program that reads questions and answers in a text file and 
asks them. For example, this file would make the program ask what "text displaying function" 
and "text asking function" are:

text displaying function = print
text asking function = input
Save this example file to questions.txt, we'll need it later.

This might seem useless to you right now, but a program like this can 
actually be really useful for learning different kinds of things. I originally 
wrote a program like this to study words of a foreign language, but then I realized 
that I could study pretty much anything with it.

But there are many things the program needs to do and writing it seems really difficult 
and complicated! How the heck can we do this?

Write functions
Our program will need to do several different things:

thisisprobablythelongestwordinthisfile and I have intentionally added it.
I am adding another anotherlongestwordinthisfile.
For fun, let's add thethridlongestworld.

Read the questions from a file.
Ask the questions.
Print statistics about how many questions were answered correctly and how many wrong.
Now everything seems much easier. We know how to do each of these steps one by one, 
but doing it all at once would be difficult. In situations like this it's important to 
define functions. We are going to write a read_questions function, an ask_questions 
function and a stats function.

Let's start with the function that reads the question file
